# Predicting Student Performance Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project uses a **Linear Regression model** to predict student performance based on factors like hours studied, previous scores, extracurricular activities, sleep hours, and sample question papers practiced.

## Dataset
The dataset contains:
- Hours Studied
- Previous Scores
- Extracurricular Activities (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- Sleep Hours
- Sample Question Papers Practiced
- Performance Index (Target variable)

## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and converting categorical data.
2. **Data Splitting**: 80% training, 20% testing.
3. **Model Selection**: Using **Linear Regression**.
4. **Training & Prediction**: Model is trained on training data and tested.
5. **Evaluation**: Metrics like MAE, MSE, and RÂ² Score are used.

## Results
The model provides predictions on student performance based on the input features.

## Future Improvements
- Try advanced models like Random Forest or Neural Networks.
- Feature engineering to enhance model accuracy.
- Hyperparameter tuning.

## Usage
Clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script for training and predictions.
